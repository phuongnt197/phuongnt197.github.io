<!-- Welcome to my personal website! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at UNIST, where I also completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree magna cum laude with a major in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in Industrial Engineering.

My research interests lie at the intersection of vision-language models, document understanding, and AI for education. Iâ€™m currently a graduate research assistant at the [Interactive Multimodal Machine Learning Lab (IMML Lab)](https://sites.google.com/view/imml-lab/home) under supervision of [Professor Taehwan Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/taehwankim), where I work on improving large vision-language models for layout recognition and automated grading systems.

Outside of research, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on creative AI projects, and capturing everyday moments through photography. -->

### About Me

Hello! I'm Thu Phuong Nguyen, a passionate and driven computer scientist currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST). I also completed my Bachelor's degree at UNIST, majoring in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering.

My research is focused on the exciting intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning. I am currently a Research Assistant at the [Interactive Multimodal Machine Learning Lab (IMML Lab)](https://sites.google.com/view/imml-lab/home) under supervision of [Professor Taehwan Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/taehwankim), where I am working to improve the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in recognizing PDF layouts and understanding complex documents. As part of this research, I also developed a VLM-based AI-automated grading system , which is part of a paper submitted to the EMNLP Main Conference 2025.

This website is a place for me to share my projects, research, and professional journey. I am always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, and opportunities in the field of AI.
