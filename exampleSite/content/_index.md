<!-- Welcome to my personal website! 👋 I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at UNIST, where I also completed my Bachelor’s degree magna cum laude with a major in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in Industrial Engineering.

My research interests lie at the intersection of vision-language models, document understanding, and AI for education. I’m currently a graduate research assistant at the [Interactive Multimodal Machine Learning Lab (IMML Lab)](https://sites.google.com/view/imml-lab/home) under supervision of [Professor Taehwan Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/taehwankim), where I work on improving large vision-language models for layout recognition and automated grading systems.

Outside of research, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on creative AI projects, and capturing everyday moments through photography. -->

### About Me

Hello! I'm Thu Phuong Nguyen, a passionate and driven computer scientist currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST). I also completed my Bachelor's degree at UNIST, majoring in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering. 

My research focuses on vision-language models (VLMs) — bringing together visual and linguistic understanding — teaching computers to interpret images, videos, and languages like humans do. I am currently a Research Assistant at the [Interactive Multimodal Machine Learning Lab (IMML Lab)](https://sites.google.com/view/imml-lab/home) under supervision of [Professor Taehwan Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/taehwankim), where I’m working on multimodal AI models, exploring how AI can understand the world through both vision and language. I’m passionate about building AI systems that not only process information, but also understand human expression across languages and modalities. 

Beyond research, I love working in multicultural teams, learning from different perspectives, and building technology that helps people connect, learn, and create across boundaries. As someone who has studied and collaborated in multicultural environments, I’m motivated by the belief that technology should help people communicate and learn beyond linguistic or visual boundaries.

This website is a place for me to share my projects, research, and professional journey. I am always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, and opportunities in the field of AI.
