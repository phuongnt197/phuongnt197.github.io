&lt;p&gt;The paper introduces VEHME, a vision-language model for automated grading of handwritten math solutions. It uses a two-phase training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning + reinforcement learning) and an Expression-Aware Visual Prompting Module to handle complex, unstructured math expressions. Evaluated on AIHub and FERMAT, VEHME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source models, and approaching proprietary models performance, making it a scalable tool for math assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I have been accepted into the Master’s program at UNIST!</title><link>https://phuongnt197.github.io/news/unist-master-join/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://phuongnt197.github.io/news/unist-master-join/</guid><description/></item><item><title>I graduated magna cum laude from UNIST with a major in CSE and a minor in IE.</title><link>https://phuongnt197.github.io/news/unist-bachelor-graduated/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://phuongnt197.github.io/news/unist-bachelor-graduated/</guid><description/></item><item><title>biography</title><link>https://phuongnt197.github.io/bio/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://phuongnt197.github.io/bio/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Attention and Augmented Recurrent Neural Networks</title><link>https://phuongnt197.github.io/distill/example/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://phuongnt197.github.io/distill/example/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ﬁrst paragraph of the article. Test a long — dash — here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test for owner’s possessive. Test for &amp;ldquo;quoting a passage.&amp;rdquo; And another sentence. Or two. Some ﬂopping ﬁns; for diving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a test of an inline equation &lt;d-math &gt;c = a^2 + b^2&lt;/d-math&gt;
. And then there’s a block equation:
&lt;d-math block &gt;
c = \pm \sqrt{ \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}{a^{222} + b^2}}
&lt;/d-math&gt;
